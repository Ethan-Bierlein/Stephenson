Each file represents a reading, selected in the 'suggested pedagogical order'.

Line formatting:
study order.chron order.line order, then tab-separation

001.079.01 arma virumque cano [fn1.add]

fn1.add indicates a footnote, which is then listed in the following format:

001.079.01.fn1.add > footnote here

I'm only inputting the original text on the left-hand columns, and my notes are eclectic, not an attempt to represent everything in Stephenson. They represent personalised notes designed to make the Latin more understandable. Additions are welcome though.
